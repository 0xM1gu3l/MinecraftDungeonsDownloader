# Minecraft Dungeons Downloader

## The beggining

Some time ago, to be more specific in July 4 of 2022, I have sumitted a bug report to mojang that allowed me to get the Minecraft Dungeons manifest from the launcher log.  
Even if you go today look at the launcher log you can see this:

Well, some time later they responded me and after this, nothing was done! So I've decided to make this repo for the people who want it for free.  
Actually until Microsoft get this repo down.
